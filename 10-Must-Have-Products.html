            <h2>Makeup: A Tool for Confidence</h2>
            <p>Makeup is a wonderful tool that can enhance your natural beauty and help you feel more confident. But with so many products on the market, it can be overwhelming to know which ones to invest in. To help you build a solid makeup kit, we’ve compiled a list of 10 must-have products that every makeup lover should have in their collection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>1. Primer</h2>
            <p>Before you apply any makeup, it’s important to prep your skin with a good primer. A primer helps to smooth out the texture of your skin and creates a barrier between your skin and your makeup, which helps it last longer. Look for a primer that suits your skin type, whether it’s oily, dry, or combination.</p>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>2. Foundation</h2>
            <p>Foundation is the base of any makeup look. It helps to even out your skin tone and provides coverage for any blemishes or imperfections. When choosing a foundation, consider your skin type and the coverage you’re looking for. If you have oily skin, you may want to look for a matte foundation, whereas if you have dry skin, a dewy foundation may be more suitable.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>3. Concealer</h2>
            <p>Concealer is a lifesaver for covering up dark circles, blemishes, and any other imperfections you want to hide. It’s important to choose a shade that matches your skin tone or is one shade lighter, and to apply it sparingly to avoid a cakey look.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>4. Setting Powder</h2>
            <p>Setting powder is the key to making your makeup last all day. It helps to keep your foundation and concealer in place and prevents it from creasing or sliding off. Look for a lightweight, translucent powder that won’t add any extra color to your skin.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>5. Eyebrow Pencil or Powder</h2>
            <p>Well-groomed eyebrows can completely transform your face. Whether you prefer a natural look or bold brows, an eyebrow pencil or powder is a must-have in your makeup kit. Look for a shade that matches your hair color and use light, feathery strokes to fill in any sparse areas.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>6. Mascara</h2>
            <p>Mascara is a staple in any makeup bag. It helps to define and lengthen your lashes, making your eyes look bigger and more awake. Look for a mascara that suits your lash type and provides the level of volume or length you desire.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>7. Eyeliner</h2>
            <p>Eyeliner is a versatile product that can be used to create a range of different looks, from a subtle daytime look to a dramatic cat eye. Whether you prefer a pencil, liquid, or gel eyeliner, make sure to choose one that is long-lasting and easy to apply.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>8. Blush</h2>
            <p>Blush adds a pop of color to your cheeks and helps to create a healthy, youthful glow. When choosing a blush, consider your skin tone and the look you’re going for. A peachy shade works well for a natural look, while a brighter pink or coral can add more drama.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>9. Lipstick or Lip Gloss</h2>
            <p>No makeup look is complete without a pop of color on your lips. Whether you prefer a classic red lipstick or a shiny lip gloss, make sure to choose a shade that complements your skin tone and the rest of your makeup look.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="product-card">
            <h2>10. Makeup Brushes</h2>
            <p>While not technically a product, good quality makeup brushes are essential for achieving a flawless finish. Look for a set that includes a variety of brush shapes and sizes, including a foundation brush, concealer brush, eyeshadow brush, and powder brush.</p>
